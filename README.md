## About The Project

Example test project to deploy apps.

### CASE STUDY

They have asked us for a web application to check the weather forecast at any
municipality of Spain. After studying the different ways to obtain this information,
has determined that it would be best to retrieve it via the AEMET API. For this we must:
1. Request an API Key from https://opendata.aemet.es/centrodedescargas/inicio.
2. Review the API documentation and find the necessary methods to retrieve the API
Next information. Specifically, we will have to locate the following services:
- Retrieve a list with all the municipalities in Spain
- Retrieve the specific prediction for a municipality
